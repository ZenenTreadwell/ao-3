AO is meant to be a stepping stone into Linux and the open source revolution. It is best setup using an hero install script that installs and configures tor, bitcoind, lightningd, and ao to startup automatically: 
```
## Alchemy 
git clone https://github.com/ZenenTreadwell/Alchemy.git 
make autonomy

```
# Nodejs 
git clone https://github.com/AutonomousOrganization/ao-3
npm install
npm run build
npm start
