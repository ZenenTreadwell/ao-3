### ao towards autonomous organization

Our choices now will create the new characteristics of human power and will determine if the semiconductor ultimately realized or destroyed liberty.  

Social interaction on Facebook's computers, financial interaction on bank computers, website interactions on Amazon's computers: who controls the computer collects the power. As a society we need to take away the great aggregation of power that has happened by conveniently using centralized services.  

As well as physically controlling the computer a computer is only really yours if you **can** know everything the software on it is doing. From the operating system up it must be open.  

There is a limited capacity for everything and our default state is complete ignorance. Modern free markets were efficient mechanisms for progress because prices and profits were conduits of information. When free participants can react in real time to new information, whether they succeed or fail more information is created. Modern Monetary Theory has completely undermined money and markets. Political manipulation muddies the information conduit. It no longer possible to learn from our markets so society itself is in a downward spiral until we can free money from politics and salvage our conduit of information.  

Bitcoin is a public money system. It is immune to political interference. It can create markets that provide information again. Humanity needs only one public money system. Bitcoin gives direct access to a store of value, to an international market to everyone. AO runs bitcoind and lightningd, a bitcoin node and lightning node that are entirely under your control and positive contributors to the open financial system.

AO is a notepad that can be used to collect your ideas and every idea is a potential checkmark, like reading that book you, or swimming in that ocean. In a very real sense your self is best described by what you do. Not by your own or others perceptions. AO can be a tool to explore honestly what it is you really are doing with the small window of opportunity your body and your health provides you. If you have an intention to discover yourself and better yourself, then AO may be worth your time to discover.

AO's notes are only on your computer. It is private to you until you share the tor onion address, then it is private to you and those you have shared the address with. Every new connection creates a new account (doge) that you can track and remove as desired. Together you can expand ideas, and can track who is realizing those ideas via checkmarks. If others desire they can send Bitcoin to any idea. That is a true support of the owner of the AO, and true communication about what is valued.

It is just a web server so it can be extended in infinitely different ways. The first step is to take your thoughts, your interaction, your life off of other peoples computers then a new world of self empowerment will flourish. In the past AO was extended to [control raspberry pi's on the local network](https://github.com/AutonomousOrganization/pi). The Pi's pins were connected to a vending machine and a door lock (decentral). Users of the decentral AO could open locked doors and dispense tasty beverages.
