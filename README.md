### ao towards autonomous organization

AO is a notepad that can be used to collect your ideas and every idea is a potential checkmark, like reading that book or swimming in the ocean. AO is meant to reflect you, not stimulate you, to explore what are you doing with the small window of opportunity your body and your health provides you. If you have an intention to discover yourself and better yourself, then AO may be worth your time to discover.

Physically controlling a computer is only ownership if you **can** know everything the software on it is doing. The true owner is whoever wrote the code you cannot read, ie Microsoft, Apple.  

AO's notes are only on your computer. It is private to you until you share the tor onion address, then it is private to you and those you have shared the address with. Together you can expand ideas and track who is realizing those ideas. Sending Bitcoin to any card is support of the owner of the AO, and true communication about what is valued.

Bitcoin is a public money system. It is immune to political interference. It can create markets that provide information again. Humanity needs only one public money system, one direct access to a store of value, one international market. AO runs a bitcoin node and lightning node that are under your control and positive contributors to the open financial system.

The first step is to take your thoughts, your interaction, your life off of other peoples computers. AO can be extended to [control raspberry pi's on the local network](https://github.com/AutonomousOrganization/pi). The Pi's pins can be connected to hardware devices like a vending machine or a door lock.

Our choices now will create the new characteristics of human power and will determine if the semiconductor ultimately realized or destroyed liberty.
