AO is meant to be a stepping stone into Linux and the open source revolution. It is best setup using an hero install script that installs and configures tor, bitcoind, lightningd, and ao to startup automatically: 
```
## Alchemy 
git clone https://github.com/ZenenTreadwell/Alchemy.git 
make autonomy

# Nodejs 
git clone https://github.com/AutonomousOrganization/ao-3
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

AO is a notepad that can be used to collect your ideas and every idea is a potential checkmark, like reading that book or swimming in the ocean. AO is meant to reflect you, not stimulate you. To explore what you do in the small window of opportunity your body and your health provides you. If you intend to honestly discover yourself and better yourself, then AO may be worth your time.

Physically controlling a computer is only ownership if you **can** know everything the software on it is doing. The true owner is whoever wrote the code you cannot read, ie Microsoft, Apple. AO runs on Linux, it is owned by you, you can share the tor onion and others can interact directly with you. Together you can expand ideas and track who is realizing those ideas. Sending Bitcoin to any card is support of the owner of the AO, and true communication about what is valued.

Bitcoin is a public money system. It is immune to political interference. Humanity needs only one public money, one universally accessible store of value, one international market. AO runs beside a bitcoin node and lightning node that are positive contributors to this blossoming open financial system.

AO can be extended to [control raspberry pi's](https://github.com/AutonomousOrganization/pi) connected to hardware like a vending machine or a lock.

The first step is to take your thoughts, your interaction, your life off of other people's computers. Our choices now will create the new characteristics of human power and will determine if the semiconductor ultimately realized or destroyed liberty.
